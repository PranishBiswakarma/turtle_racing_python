# Turtle Racing Game (Python)

A simple turtle racing game using the Python `turtle` module where multiple turtles race vertically across the screen with random speeds.

## How It Works

- The user selects the number of turtles (2-10) to race.
- Each turtle is assigned a unique color and positioned evenly at the start line.
- Turtles race by moving forward random increments until one crosses the finish line.
- The game announces the winning turtle's color.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory.
4. Run the Python script by typing: python project.py
5. Follow the prompts on screen to enter the number of turtles and watch the race.

## What I Learned and Used

- Python’s `turtle` graphics for simple 2D animations.
- Taking user input and validating ranges.
- Positioning graphical objects dynamically based on user input.
- Generating random numbers to simulate race progress.
- Using loops to control animation flow and detect race completion.
- Combining GUI and command line interaction for an engaging game.
